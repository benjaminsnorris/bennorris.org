My wife and I attended a homeschool parent evening presented by [Liberty Rock School](http://www.libertyrockschool.org/), and had a wonderful time. [Diann Jepsen](https://familyeducationcoach.com) presented about preparing our children for college, and I wanted to make sure to remember the great content, so I took sketchnotes of the event:
