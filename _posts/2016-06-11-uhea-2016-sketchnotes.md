For the second time, I was invited to present on sketchnotes at the [UHEA Convention](http://www.uhea.org/2016-uhea-convention/), and my wife and were thrilled to attend together. We have homeschooled our children for over five years now, and have had a great experience. I sketchnoted a few of the sessions that we attended, and wanted to share those.
