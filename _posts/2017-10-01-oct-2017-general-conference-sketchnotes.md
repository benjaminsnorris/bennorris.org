This conference was a special experience. Our sixth child was born two days ago, and my wife and I were able to experience all of conference together. The Saturday sessions we watched in the hospital room, and the Sunday sessions we watched at home. The other five children were with Grandma, so we were able to concentrate and listen to each session. What a blessing! I tried a new approach and sketchnoted a synopsis of each session. ‚úçüèº‚õ™Ô∏è
