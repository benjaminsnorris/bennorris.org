Right after I [posted some clips](https://bennorris.com/2022/09/19/in-your-body) from a Jocko Underground podcast, a new episode came out. I loved the analogy Jocko gave of being stuck in a forest and needing to start walking to figure out where you are and where to go.

He summed it up so well: “You’re not going to be able to do anything until you do something.”
