They were thick, genuine, hand-sewn leather. They were soft and worn in with a beautiful patina.<br><br>When the server took our order, I asked if I could keep my menu. I set it on the table beside me so I could look at it and run my fingers over it throughout the meal. As Ferris Bueller would say, “It was so choice.”<br><br>I almost wish that I would have thought to take a picture of it. But I’m also happy that it didn’t even occur to me. I was so captivated that I was completely in the moment enjoying it.<br><br>When I turned to the back, I saw that it was made by <a href="https://www.rustico.com/">Rustico</a>, a small company specializing in fine leather products. <br><br>My wife got me a nice journal a while ago from them that I have recently rediscovered and  have been loving:<br><br>  <figure class="attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg">

  </figure><br><br>At the restaurant, my wife told me it would not be appropriate to ask the server if I could buy the menu. At first she thought I was joking, but then realized I was seriously planning on it. Luckily she talked some sense into me.<br><br>I was struck by the joy a quality product brought me. That lunch was made so much more enjoyable by the presence of the menu.<br><br>My hope is to find and savor those moments more often. It is a happy way to live.</div>
