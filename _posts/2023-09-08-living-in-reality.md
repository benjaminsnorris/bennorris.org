My life is filled with impossible contractions. This week brought one of those to the forefront for me.

***

Sometimes I write because I have something to say. Something to share. Something I’ve learned. Other times I write to figure out what I’m thinking. This is one of the latter.

Part of living with [OCD](https://bennorris.com/tags/ocd/) is confronting conflicting ideas and allowing both to be true simultaneously. Maybe it’s actually just part of living for everyone, but I know that I struggled with it much more before I began recovery.

I must avoid precious routines. They’re not a problem in and of themselves, but when they feel necessary for life to go well, or to have a good day, or for any other reason, they transform. [They become compulsions](https://bennorris.com/2022/03/12/losing-my-routine).

The irony is that some habits really do help my day and life go better. Examples of those include:

- Waking by 6:00
- Exercising
- [Cold showers](https://bennorris.com/2022/08/26/experimenting-with-discomfort)
- Healthy eating
- [Free writing](https://bennorris.com/tags/free-writing/)
- Studying scriptures
- Planning
- Chatting with my wife
- Tucking kids in
- Brushing teeth
- Flossing

All of those go in phases for me. I’ll do well for a while, and then ignore them completely for a bit. My quest has been to incorporate them into my life without becoming obsessive about them.

One key I’ve found is tracking. [Many people benefit from it](https://austinkleon.com/2013/12/29/something-small-every-day/), and I love apps like [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com/).

But I cannot track habits.

That is one of the surest ways to [transform an activity](https://bennorris.com/2022/04/15/breaking-streaks) from enjoyable and helpful into an oppressive overlord demanding to be accomplished and threatening destruction if failed.

Another challenging aspect of routines is that [I struggle with plan changes](https://bennorris.com/tags/plan-change/). A lot.

So I find myself trying to walk a fine line between preventing routines from becoming compulsions, and the reality of the toll that flexibility extracts from me. I can make plan changes—they just hurt and come at a cost.

Over the past week, every single day has started with an adjustment requested or required. From last-minute presentations to family situations, I’ve been faced with a number of plan changes.

I feel spent.

There’s a part of me that knows this is good for me. That God is pushing and stretching and teaching me. That I need, and even want, to learn to be more flexible.

And there’s another part of me that screams, “Enough!”

As I went for a walk yesterday, I found myself thinking, “It’s like everyone had forgotten that I live with a debilitating mental illness. Just because I’ve been holding things together lately doesn’t mean that I’m ok. It was just a year ago that I was completely incapacitated for a time, being shut down by paralyzing panic attacks. I don’t want to go back there.”

For me, the key continues to be [extreme ownership](https://bennorris.com/tags/extreme-ownership/). I cannot let myself fall into victimhood. I must own my [OCD](https://bennorris.com/tags/ocd/), especially how I respond to it.

I need to [allow my emotions](https://bennorris.com/2019/05/02/allowing-emotions) and recognize when I am hitting my limits before I exceed them.

I know my reality. Now I need to live within it.
