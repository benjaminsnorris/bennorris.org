[Jocko](https://bennorris.com/tags/jocko/) cracks me up. On a recent podcast episode, he was talking about why you should get the kids books he’s written first.

> If you’re cognizant enough to order something from Amazon, order the kids books first. ‘Cause you, look, your life is half over at this point… You’ve got one foot in the grave. But your kids, they’ve got their whole life ahead of them. Might as well get them on the path.
