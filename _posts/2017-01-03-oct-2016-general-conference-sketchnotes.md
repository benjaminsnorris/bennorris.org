I had a wonderful time sketchnoting a talk a day for my personal studies from the [Oct 2016 General Conference](https://www.lds.org/church/events/october-2016-general-conference). Included here are links to my sketchnotes from each of the sessions, as well as a PDF of all of the sketchnotes. I hope it is uplifting and inspiring for you as it has been for me.
