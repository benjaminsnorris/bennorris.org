This spoke to me deeply this morning from Amy Wright: [Christ Heals That Which Is Broken](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/42wright?id=p29-p30&lang=eng#p29).

> My dear friends, we all have something in our lives that is broken that needs to be mended, fixed, or healed. As we turn to the Savior, as we align our hearts and minds with Him, as we repent, He comes to us “with healing in his wings,” puts His arms lovingly around us, and says, “It’s OK. You are only 5﻿—or 16, 23, 48, 64, 91. We can fix this together!”
> 
> I testify that there is nothing in your life that is broken that is beyond the curative, redeeming, and enabling power of Jesus Christ.
