The next installment in my continuing series of sketchnotes produced for The Company Corporation (<a href="http://www.incorporate.com" title="The Company Corporation">Incorporate.com</a>) is from a webinar about maximizing your tax benefits as a small business owner. This was delivered by Sandy Botkin, from <a href="https://taxbot.com" title="Taxbot.com" target="_blank">Taxbot.com</a>. He is a CPA and a former trainer for the IRS, so his perspective was invaluable. It was a fantastic session for small business owners about how to make sure that you are taking advantages of the laws that are created to help build your business. I learned a great deal, and enjoyed sketchnoting it.
