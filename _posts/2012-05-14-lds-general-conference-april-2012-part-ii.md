A few weeks ago, I <a title="LDS General Conference AprilÂ 2012" href="https://www.bennorris.blog/2012/04/05/lds-general-conference.html">posted</a> my sketchnotes captured live during the last LDS General Conference. As I noted in that post, I am also a Romanian interpreter, so there are always a number of talks that I am not able to listen to during the actual conference. Over the course of the weeks that followed, I listened to all of the talks that I "missed" and thought I would share the resulting sketchnotes.
