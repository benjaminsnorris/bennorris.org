My thoughts on and appreciation for the delightful podcast, [The Hilarious World of Depression](http://hilariousworld.org).

To John Moe and co.,

Thank you. The work you have done in creating and continuing THWoD is truly life-changing. I began dealing with mental health issues in the summer of 2018. I browsed the podcast directory in [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) looking for comedy shows, and stumbled upon THWoD. Great job on the name by the way. I was drawn in, and all of my many recommendations have been met with a smile at hearing the name.

As I listened to guests share their stories with mental illness, I found validation. As you have mentioned many times, one of the problems with mental illness is that it convinces you that are you alone, a freak, an aberration. Hearing that others felt the same gave me a new level of self-compassion.

The more I listened and progressed in my journey, the more I wanted to share. I finally had the courage to write my own [coming out story](https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/26/coming-out.html) with mental illness. I found the fear my brain fed me at sharing the personal details of my life was a lie. I received an outpouring of love and compassion, and many people shared their mental health struggles with me.

I recently returned to work after a couple months off for a medical leave of absence. I have tried to share personal details of my struggles with people who ask why I was out. And I have found that those conversations result in the most meaningful and authentic bonding experiences I have had at work.

THWoD continues to be a major part of my life. I tell almost everyone it is my favorite podcast right now. My kids were intrigued and perplexed when I told them about it. ‚ÄúUh, Dad, I don‚Äôt think depression is very hilarious‚Ä¶‚Äù

It is clear this is a labor of love. You truly care about what you are creating and the impact it has in the world. John, I‚Äôm sure that it takes a toll on you to invest yourself in connecting with the darkest parts of people‚Äôs lives. I want you to know what a difference the show has made for me.

Here are some of my favorite moments:

- Learning that good psychiatrists exist and are worth finding
- [Discovering Fernando](https://www.bennorris.org/2019/03/26/what-intrusive-thoughts.html), my very own ‚ÄúSteve‚Äù
- [Connecting with John Green](https://www.bennorris.org/2019/01/26/this-episode-was.html) and knowing he shared my diagnosis of OCD well before it came out in the interview
- [Realizing how asinine it is to believe we do our best work while mentally tortured](https://www.bennorris.org/2019/02/11/playing-through-injuries.html)
- [Accepting myself as I am without being a comedian](https://www.bennorris.org/2019/04/01/not-a-comedian.html)
- [Finishing all back episodes](https://bennorris.org/2019/03/11/just-finished-season.html)

Thank you again, and I wish you all the best as you continue your own mental health journey.
