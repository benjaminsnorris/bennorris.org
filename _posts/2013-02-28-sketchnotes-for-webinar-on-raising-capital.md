The third installment of the series for The Company Corporation (<a href="http://www.incorporate.com" title="The Company Corporation">Incorporate.com</a>) was another fantastic resource for small business owners. This was focused on how to raise capital for your business, and making sure that you have considered all of the ramifications.

I had noticed that my sketchnotes had all been in the same basic layout: top to bottom and left to right in something of a "Z" pattern. So this time I tried a completely different layout, and I loved it! Doing something different pushed me a bit out of my comfort zone, and I was pleased the with end result. Hopefully you enjoy it too!
