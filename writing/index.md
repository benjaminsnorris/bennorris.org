One of the greatest technologies we have for communicating with each other is the written word. While I am not a professional writer, I constantly aspire to be better.

My personal blog is a place for me to share whatever is on my mind. Much of what I write here is related to parenting, leadership, or mental health.

This is a passion project of mine. I deal with severe OCD, and have found that as I share about my experiences, I understand them better, and it creates space for others to share their story as well. So that itâ€™s easier to remember, you can find my story at [mwh.is/personal](http://mwh.is/personal).
