This site is my online home. I make a number of stops around the web, but enjoy a steady resting place.

Most of my time online is spent either at my personal blog [bennorris.blog](https://bennorris.blog), or working to reduce the stigma of mental health in the workplace at [mentalworkhealth.org](https://mentalworkhealth.org).

I also regularly post sketchnotes, either business-related at [sketchnotable.com](https://sketchnotable.com) or religious at [gospelsketcher.org](https://gospelsketcher.org).
