## Backstory

This app was the reason that I became an iOS developer. As a family, we follow the [Charlotte Mason scripture memory system](https://simplycharlottemason.com/timesavers/memorysys/), which involved a box of index cards. We would recite scripture verses on the cards every morning. The problem was that our young children would regularly dump out all of the cards, and we would lose our progress. I wanted to make a simple app that would replace the box of cards, and pursued iOS development to create that app.
