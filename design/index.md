My personal website has gone through many different iterations, which now serve to highlight some of my web design experience.


## [Sketchbook design](https://sketchbook.bennorris.org)

This was my first website to design alone every part of it. In the middle of 2013 when I did this, I was using sketchbooks constantly and decided to make the design skeuomorphic and to show off my new CSS skills. It was a blast to make.


## [Flat design](https://sketchbook.bennorris.org?design=flat)

At the time that I created the sketchbook design (2013), skeuomorphic design was falling out of fashion, and the trend was flat design. I wanted to show that I was aware of this and was able to do both styles, and so I created an alternate design for the same site that users could toggle between.


## [Static blog](https://old-blog.bennorris.org)

This served as my main website, including blog and microblog, from the middle of 2016 until the middle of 2018 when I moved to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog). I hosted the site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and configured it to support writing and publishing from mobile devices.

I started with an open-source design, and then tweaked everything to have the CSS exactly how I wanted. After a couple years, I found that I spent too much time tweaking the design and wanted to spend more time actually writing.


## [Current blog](https://bennorris.blog)

The [vision of Micro.blog](http://help.micro.blog/2015/why-i-created-this/) resonates strongly with me, and I enjoying supporting them and participating in the humane community they have created. I have continued to tweak the design and templates of my site there, notably adding support for light and dark modes.
