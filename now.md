*Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff), this is an insight into what I’m doing and thinking about right now.* 

*Last updated: 14 Aug 21.*

The most important thing I’m doing right now is continuing to recover from and deal with my OCD. I am working to strike the right balance between my personal, family, professional, and spiritual lives. I write about mental health and my journey [Mental Work Health](/mental-work-health/).

My day job is mobile manager at [O.C. Tanner](https://www.octanner.com) where I am lucky to lead a great team building world-class iOS apps.

I also publish some of my own apps on the side through my business [BSN Design](https://bsn.design).

One of my biggest hobbies is sketchnoting, and I post business sketchnotes in [Sketchnotable](/sketchnotable/) and religious sketchnotes in [Gospel Sketcher](/gospel-sketcher/).
