My name is Ben Norris. I live in Utah with my wife and seven kids. I am a mobile manager at [O.C. Tanner](https://octanner.com) and publish my own iOS apps at [BSN Design](https://bsn.design). I also love sketchnoting, and publish business-type sketchnotes at [sketchnotable.com](https://sketchnotable.com) and religious sketchnotes at [gospelsketcher.org](https://gospelsketcher.org).

My newest project is [mentalworkhealth.org](https://mentalworkhealth.org), where I am working to increase awareness and decrease stigma around mental health, especially in the workplace.

Feel free to reach out to me at [info@bennorris.org](mailto:info@bennorris.org?subject=Hello%20from%20your%20website).
