If you need a bio to introduce me, this is what I have come up with.

> Ben Norris has been coding off and on for over twenty years. He currently works as engineering manager at O.C. Tanner leading the mobile apps team. He is also a mental health advocate, working to increase awareness and decrease stigma of mental health, especially in the workplace. His regular writing on mental health, family, leadership, and more can be found at bennorris.com.
> 
> He and his wife live in Lehi, Utah with their seven children, ages 15 down to infant, whom they have been homeschooling since before it was cool. His hobbies include sketchnoting and wearing noise-cancelling headphones around the house. He recently shaved off long, flowing locks of curly hair, to general applause but cries of revulsion from some of his kids.
